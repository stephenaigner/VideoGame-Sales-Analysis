# Video Game Sales Analysis

### Project Description:
This project was an analysis on video game sales during their year of release in different regions from 1980 to 2020. The data was sourced from a public site: [Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales). I developed a PostrgreSQL database, imported the data (csv file) into the table, and performed a series of queries to analyze the data (see below). I then created interactive data visualizations with Tableau BI Software linked here: [Tableau Data Visualizations.](https://public.tableau.com/views/VideoGameSalesReport_17005335889750/SalesDashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

Dashboard key metrics:

* Video game sales performance during release year
* Total sales count and percentage for each region
* Yearly sales from 1980 - 2020
* Sales for top 5 platforms, genres, and publishers
* Filters for year, platform, genre, and publisher
