# Video Game Sales Analysis

### Project Description:
* This project was an analysis on video game sales during their year of release in different regions from 1980 to 2020. The data was sourced from a public site: [Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales)
* I created a PostrgreSQL database and then imported the data (csv file) into the table. I performed a series of queries to analyze the data (see below). I then developed interactive data visualizations with Tableau BI Software linked here: [Tableau Data Visualizations.](https://public.tableau.com/views/VideoGameSalesAnalysis_16996624076180/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
The number of sales is millions of copies. I created filters for year, genre, platform, and publisher. The second dashboard displays the sales for top 5 genres, platforms, and publishers with the year filter.
